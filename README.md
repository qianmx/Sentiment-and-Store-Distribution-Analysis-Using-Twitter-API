# Sentiment-and-Store-Distribution-Analysis-Using-Twitter-API
Key word: Pulling data from REST APIs; Extracting store distribution data from web pages; Sentiment analysis

In this project, I developed a framework that extracts people’s sentiment towards certain brands/companies across 50 states in the US through Twitter. It can help companies understand people’s feeling about the brand, determine their expansion strategy across the US, as well as assess their current store distribution. I used Nike as an example in the code and analyzed its store distribution strategy. However, it can be customoized to any other brands/companies.
